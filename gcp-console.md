Look at 
[GCP REGION  picker](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/region-picker/ "How to choose your region?").
Think about cost and energy production needed for your server to run.

These are the steps to be followed that will help you to create your virtual machine.

![GCP create instance](images/CreateInstance.png "Create instance")

Note that if this is the first time to use GCP, or you don't have any existing projects, you'll be asked to create a project

![GCP_Select_or_Create](images/select-project.png "Select or Create Project")
![GCP_Create_Project](images/create-project.png "Create Project")

You will also need to "Enable" the Compute Engine API when prompted.
